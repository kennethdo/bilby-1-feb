Read the Figma design at https://www.figma.com/design/JeBNlyIXgrcyQ1rwyfpebB/Bilby?node-id=3463-1194 for the About page, then: 1) Replace the technical white paper placeholder with the actual design from Figma (or remove if not in design), 2) Update staff roles and names to match Figma exactly, 3) Ensure spacing, typography, and layout match the Figma design. Use the Figma MCP tool (get_design_context with fileKey JeBNlyIXgrcyQ1rwyfpebB) to read the actual design. Follow React best practices — extract reusable components if sections repeat patterns.",
