# Ralph Test App Learnings

## Codebase Patterns
- Database module (src/db.js) exports both `db` (singleton instance) and `initializeDatabase` (factory function)
- Tests use `delete require.cache[require.resolve(...)]` to get fresh module instances when needed
- Node built-in test runner with `node:test` and `node:assert` - test files at tests/*.test.js
- better-sqlite3 with WAL mode enabled for better concurrent read performance

## Gotchas
- Express 5.x is used (not 4.x) - check for API differences if something doesn't work as expected
- data/ directory and data/app.db are created at runtime - add to .gitignore if not already there
